In the javascript folder, you will find index.mjs file that contains the logic to control keys as the previous button and next button, but also, here it is the code to play music background or sound of a key.

The main part of this file is the POST request, it  does a request to /pokeapi route ubicated in the routes folder then it does GET request to pokeapi , so which receives data of pokemon such as the image of pokemon and its name;
